                    <p style="font-family: 'Varela Round', sans-serif;"><b>Born on: 6th, 15th and 24th of a month</b>.</p>

					<p style="font-family: 'Varela Round', sans-serif;">The hallmark of people born on these dates is their sense of responsibility and maturity. They are known for their ability to be trustworthy. In fact, these traits further go deep into expression as love for their family & hence born on these dates makes them an efficient family person. Their love for family and close associates is most profound and they can go to any extreme to keep this bond intact. They know and show that they care and here they can be very sacrificing. However, this behaviour many times can be extreme making them overprotective and possessive about the ones they love.</p>

					<p style="font-family: 'Varela Round', sans-serif;">The other trait shown by people born on these dates is their quick and analytical thinking. They can be most rational in analysing a situation and interpreting an outcome.  Creativity and artistic ability are also their strengths, however, for many, these are often left suppressed or undeveloped. This is more often or not due to sacrifice for the wellbeing of own family, which always comes first over their ambitions. </p>

					<p style="font-family: 'Varela Round', sans-serif;">The date-of-birth also gifts fine taste. As such they like to be well dressed and have a particular knack of choosing the right colour and designs.</p>

					<p style="font-family: 'Varela Round', sans-serif;">Many born on these dates do exceptionally well when working in an environment that involves taking a team along or working with the public at large. Their keen sense of bonding and harmony can take them places if supported by a balanced name.</p>
