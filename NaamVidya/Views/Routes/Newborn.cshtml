						<p>How to choose a name for a newborn?</p>
					</div>
                    <p style="font-family:century gothic;">Firstly, if you are reading this and have a newborn or about to enter parenthood, Hooray!!!</p>
					<p style="font-family:century gothic;">NaamVidya congratulates you & welcomes you to the most beautiful phase of life! :-)</p>
					<p style="font-family:century gothic;">We receive many questions on how one should go about choosing a balanced name for the new-born and hence decided to put forward our thoughts around it.</p>
					<p style="font-family:century gothic;">At NaamVidya we completely understand that selecting a perfect name for your newborn is not an easy task and can get very confusing to arrive upon the perfect identity for your child.</p>
					<p style="font-family:century gothic;">However, considering that name is going to remain with your child all his life and be the first thing that people will learn about him/her, it’s worth taking the time and efforts to find that perfectly balanced name.</p>
					<p style="font-family:century gothic;">Well, if we had to structure this so-called quest for the perfect name, we would say that there are two parts to it:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Choosing the right name.</li>
						<li>Identifying whether it is balanced to child's purpose in life, his inborn strengths, and if it is not, then how do we make it happen.</li>
					</ol>
					<p style="font-family:century gothic;">While NaamVidya can help you with both, we also understand that name assignment is a very personal family matter and our suggested name may sometimes not resonate perfectly with yours.</p>
					<p>This is fine. In fact, we strongly recommend that parents and guardians themselves take up the name shortlisting affair with all the enthusiasm. After all, it's once in a lifetime opportunity!</p>
					<p style="font-family:century gothic;">Given below are general guidelines which you can follow to shortlist names, before sending it to us for Name Balance review:</p>
					<p style="font-family:century gothic;" color="red"><b>CAUTION:</b> Please do not attempt to balance a name by yourself, after reading a book or the free name analysis given on our website. Balancing a name to destiny is a science and can have adverse effects if done incorrectly.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Focus on vibration of your thoughts.</li>
					</ol>
					<p style="font-family:century gothic;">
						We give the highest weightage to Vibration of thoughts. At a time when you have just entered parenthood or about to enter one, your mind is full of positive thoughts and happiness.
					</p>
					<p style="font-family:century gothic;">The names that comes to mind during such times have a lot of personal vibration of love and as such, help build a strong bond between you and your child.</p>
					<p style="font-family:century gothic;"><b>A special tip here:</b> Always make note of the first name that comes to your or spouse's mind when you begin your day's journey thinking of a name. Often, the name comes from your subconscious mind and is the one which is the best suited.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>A respect to history, ancestors, and tradition.</li>
					</ol>
					<p style="font-family:century gothic;">It's always a good idea to have a name which respects a noble soul in a family or elsewhere, especially if he/she has made a positive difference to you or family.</p>
					<p style="font-family:century gothic;">Think of a way to have his/her name incorporated in your child's name, in part, in initial or whole. Believe us, not only does it brings with itself a lot of blessings, but also, at times some of the finer positive traits of the blessed soul get passed on as a gift to the child.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Pronounce it right:</li>
					</ol>
					<p style="font-family:century gothic;">Always remember, it is going to be smaller world with lesser boundaries with time. The likelihood of your child interacting with someone outside your cultural and country boundaries is very high.</p>
					<p style="font-family:century gothic;">Hence, it's very important that your name is pronounced right when people read it, not only in the society and country you live in, but also outside of it.</p>
					<p style="font-family:century gothic;">Thanks to advancement in technology, a good way to handle this is to have your name pronounced by online translation tools such as available from google, Microsoft/Bing </p>
					<p>These sites can help you know how your child's name will be pronounced in various countries. Try it, not only it is interesting, but a fun exercise too!</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Mean it right:</li>
					</ol>
					<p style="font-family:century gothic;">Just as the pronunciation, understand that your loved cultural name may not mean the same internationally. So, it's always a good practice to have its meaning checked in countries outside your own. There are many sites online (Google, Bing, Yahoo etc…) which can help you do the check.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Initials check:</li>
					</ol>
					<p style="font-family:century gothic;">A full name initial is a very important check. e.g. <b>A</b>shok <b>S</b>urendra <b>S</b>harma, <b>M</b>ohsin <b>A</b>hmed <b>D</b>ar, <b>S</b>usan <b>O</b>liver <b>B</b>erry, <b>R</b>ick <b>A</b>rthur <b>T</b>ravolta may not sound the best & for obvious reasons.</p>
					<ol><li>Keep it Short, if your last name is Long.</li></ol>
					<p style="font-family:century gothic;">Not only are short names easy to spell, but also easier to combine if your last name is long or bit complicated for everyone to pronounce. Try a few in your mind and you will know what we mean.</p>
					<ol><li>Popular name, with a bit of caution:</li></ol>
					<p style="font-family:century gothic;">Some parents like naming their baby with a popular name of a person- like a celebrity. We advise a bit more introspection here. As while the popularity of a name may be a at a high today for positive reasons, the same may not be the case in future, due to a negative incident.</p>
					<ol><li>Names lasting a lifetime.</li></ol>
					<p style="font-family:century gothic;">Make sure the name you give your child will last a lifetime. A cute name that suits a baby or young child, may not suit him/her as a teenager or adult.</p>
