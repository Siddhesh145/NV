						<p>THE IMPORTANCE OF A NAME!</p>
					</div>
                    <!--<p style="font-family: 'Varela Round', sans-serif;text-align:center;"><b>The world was formed by a vibration, the vibration of the sound “OM”.<br/><sub>-Upanishad</sub></b></p>-->
					<!-- <p style="font-family: 'Varela Round', sans-serif;"><b><sub>-Upanishad</sub></b></p> -->
					<p style="font-family: 'Varela Round', sans-serif;">Success, Happiness, and Health of every person is an outcome of his <b>“Mind”</b>, The <b>"Thoughts"</b> that arise out of it and the subsequent <b>“Action”</b> taken. As a result, depending on a type of a Mind, some people develop <b>Positive Thoughts</b> and hence are optimist, go-getters and successful. While some develop <b>Negative Thought,</b> and hence are either destructive or worrying, lack confidence, unsuccessful, and suffer from bad health.</p>
					<p style="font-family: 'Varela Round', sans-serif;">The essence is that it is the mind and the thoughts arising out of it that are responsible for a person’s nature, attitude and his actions.</p>
					<p style="font-family: 'Varela Round', sans-serif;"><b>The question is can the Mind be conditioned to be positive? </b></p>
					<p style="font-family: 'Varela Round', sans-serif;">Yes, and the solution lies in the fact that our Mind is governed and learns from our 5 Senses - 1. Ears or Sound, 2. Eyes or Visual, 3. Nose or Smell, 4. Fingers or Touch and 5. Tongue or Taste.</p>
					<p style="font-family: 'Varela Round', sans-serif;">Of the above, it is scientifically proven that Sound and Visual are the strongest, and play the most vital role in conditioning the mind.</p>
					<p style="font-family: 'Varela Round', sans-serif;"><b>Have you ever wondered why Mantras were given to people to ward off fear and evil? </b>The reason was that all the fears and struggle of a person actually reside in his mind and thoughts. And a Mantra through the vibration of its sound and visual conditioned a mind to get over these problems. Nothing More. Nothing Less.</p>
					<p style="font-family: 'Varela Round', sans-serif;">In fact, this was the rationale behind the science of <b>Mantra Yoga</b> discovered by Sages century ago.</p>
					<p style="font-family: 'Varela Round', sans-serif;">The science believed that with the right and precise choice of words, you could condition the mind to rise above of its perceived limitations and achieve success in your objective. In fact, all sages used the power of Mantra is some form or other to achieve nirvana or liberation.</p>
					<p style="font-family: 'Varela Round', sans-serif;">Your name plays a similar role to a Mantra, only it is your own personal Mantra that you relate, hear, connect, and resonate with every day. Hence, a name with right vibration can condition a Mind to develop positive thoughts and bring success or with a wrong vibration develop negativity and attract failures, and affect health.</p>
					<p style="font-family: 'Varela Round', sans-serif;">The other more important part of a name is whether it is balanced to the strengths a person is born with (understood by analysing his date-of-birth). Given below is a summary of the Strengths to a date-of-birth:</p>

					If you look around carefully, you will observe that every person born on a specific date given above exhibit associated traits. However, depending on the vibration of a name, these traits are either further strengthened or are suppressed.</p>
                    <p style="font-family: 'Varela Round', sans-serif;">
                        For example, a person born on 3rd, 12th, 21st, 30th, if unknowingly is given a name that vibrates to a number of “7”, will always have his artistic and expressive talents suppressed. This is because the vibration of Number “7” conditions and pushes the mind to be more theoretical and quiet, while his date-of-birth wants him to be expressive.
					</p>
                    <p style="font-family: 'Varela Round', sans-serif;">
                        Hence a person with disharmony of Date-of-Birth and Name always feels frustrated and is unable to reach his destined success and happiness in life. All this because of his inability to express what his heart or life path desires him to achieve.
					</p>
                    <p style="font-family: 'Varela Round', sans-serif;">
                        In summary, a name should be chosen most carefully to ensure that:<br/>
                        1.	Allows nurturing of the talents a person is born with.<br />
                        2.	Provide him/her with the right personality, strength & health.<br />
                        3.	Attracts a favourable destiny to fulfil his purpose of life.<br />
					</p>
                    <p style="font-family: 'Varela Round', sans-serif;">
