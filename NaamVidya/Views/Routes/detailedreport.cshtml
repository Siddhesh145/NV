                            <p style="text-align:center;"><b>What this section means</b></p>
                            <p>Every person enters the material world at a specific date of birth and time. Being unchangeable, this date of birth gives a good clarity on the way to fulfil his/her Purpose in Life.</p>
                            <p><b>It is this purpose of life, which you should follow to have ultimate peace, success, and happiness in life.</b></p>
                            <p>However, whether you can fulfil this <b>Purpose</b> depends upon your <b>Name</b>, as it is the <b>Name</b> that shapes your nature and personality. </p>
                            <p>More importantly, it is your name that gives you the ability to utilise the maturity and talents that your soul or subconscious mind has learned through all the previous births and life existences.</p>

                            <p><b>The law of Karma states that it is your duty to fulfil this purpose, utilizing these strengths.</b></p>
                            <p>Inability to utilise them often shows up as a feeling of dissatisfaction or something missing in later years of life. More so, as the karma fulfilling itself is inevitable. However, it’s manifestation without a person being mentally prepared (due to lack of nurturing of strengths) is what leads to uncertainties or unfavourable circumstances in life.</p>

                            <p><b>{{firstName}}</b>, the next section analyses your first name and will gives an indication whether your Name is supporting your journey to fulfil the purpose in life. It also details if it is conditioning your mind to utilize the strengths from birth.</p>
                            <p>Importantly, the difference in balance (if any) is expressed as weakness and shortcomings in your life.</p>
                            <p>In fact, many a time these shortcomings get magnified, as the name has wrong vibrations of its’ own, which introduce weakness of its own.</p>

                            <p>Your full name creates your true nature and remains till your last breath. The effect of full name begins when you are ready to take responsibilities in life, mature, and become independent of any support.</p>
                            <p>Note: Even if your first name has given you strengths and abilities, your full name (if unbalanced) can have an opposite effect and instead attract failures.</p>

                            <p>If you took this analysis for a newborn or child in early years, a balanced name is the biggest gift that can be given, as the effect and vibrations of a balanced name start much earlier.

                            <p>Some of the benefits of a balanced name are as follows:</p>
