                    <p style="font-family: 'Varela Round', sans-serif;"><b>Born on: 1st, 10th, 19th, and 28th of a month</b>.</p>

					<p style="font-family: 'Varela Round', sans-serif;">The most noticeable trait that is seen of people born on any of these dates is their independence. This independence is not necessarily in ideas, but in their approach to life. They don't mind living their own life and at their own terms. In fact, they seldom need a company or seek guidance to do a task. They are usually happy in their own way of seeing and approaching life. </p>

					<p style="font-family: 'Varela Round', sans-serif;">The other noticeable trait with this independence is their keen sense of creativity. Birth on these dates gives them immense ability to be artistic and creative in their imagination and work.  They can come up with great innovative ways to complete a work. </p>

					<p style="font-family: 'Varela Round', sans-serif;">Also added to this date-of-birth is absolute perseverance and sincerity to tasks. Not only are they courageous, but also have a serious strive to complete what they wish to or have interest in. Leave them with their interest and they will always come out successful in their work. </p>

					<p style="font-family: 'Varela Round', sans-serif;">With all these wonderful traits, it makes them excellent leaders who always have clarity on the situation and the decision to be taken, even though at times on the surface they may show otherwise. </p>

					<p style="font-family: 'Varela Round', sans-serif;">Having said that, all this comes with a nature that can be very egotistical and an expression which can be very direct and harsh. Birth on this date often makes them authoritative and gives inherent trait to put forward views without hesitation. If a particular message has to be given and is right in their view, they won't blink an eye to express it, even if it is at the expense of offending the other person. </p>
