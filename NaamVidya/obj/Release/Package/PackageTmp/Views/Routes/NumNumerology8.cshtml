                 <p style="font-family: 'Varela Round', sans-serif;"><b>Born on: 8th, 17th, 26th of a month.</b></p>


   <p style="font-family: 'Varela Round', sans-serif;">The hallmark of people born on this date is their ambition and drive to accumulate material wealth.  The ability to drive large teams and masses to success comes to them naturally, however always with an interest to accumulate material gains or to be successful. It is their self-confidence, energy and hardworking attitude that makes them stand apart and makes them come across as executives.</p>

   <p style="font-family: 'Varela Round', sans-serif;">Limelight matters to them a lot and hence you often see them particular about their dressing, the way they carry themselves and their eating habits. They are people of fine taste and are most expressive in demonstrating it.</p>

   <p style="font-family: 'Varela Round', sans-serif;">A master organiser, the date of birth gifts authority and if channelled correctly is often for the betterment of masses. Having said the positives, the date-of-birth also requires a harmonious name to rightly express the power it carries.</p>
<p style="font-family: 'Varela Round', sans-serif;">In unbalanced cases, it can make the person extremely dominating, aggressive and bossy, making them a difficult person to deal with, invariably affection relationships. In fact, the drive and ambition to make it big can often make them shrewd and remain unsatisfied in life. </p>

   <p style="font-family: 'Varela Round', sans-serif;">There is also a mystical trait assigned to people born on this date. This is shown in their extreme dominance and magnetism to attract people, important events, matter, and work associated with number or date's 4 and 8. In fact, most people born on this date either have parents born on date of 4th or 8th, have spouse born on these dates or bear children with similar dates. </p>
   <p style="font-family: 'Varela Round', sans-serif;">Due to extreme affinity to date 4 and 8 throughout life, it is advised that people born on this date balance out their life with other numbers to negate any over influence of their core number 4 and 8. This includes not having a "Name Number" which rounds up to 4 or 8, avoiding important dates in life that fall on 4th or 8th of a month (i.e. 4th, 8th, 13th, 17th, 22nd, 26th, 31st). Failing to do this, the date-of-birth often attracts unwanted hardships and struggles in life. </p>
